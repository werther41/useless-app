# Production Protection Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for protecting your production deployments when making your repository public.

## 🚨 Critical Protection Steps

### 1. **Enable Branch Protection Rules**

#### GitHub Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches**
3. Click **Add rule** for the `main` branch
4. Configure these settings:

```
✅ Require a pull request before merging
✅ Require approvals (set to 1-2 reviewers)
✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
✅ Include administrators (IMPORTANT!)
```

#### Required Reviewers

- Add yourself as a required reviewer
- Add any other maintainers
- Ensure at least 1-2 approvals are required

### 2. **Configure Environment Protection**

#### Vercel Environment Protection

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → **Your Project** → **Settings** → **Git**
2. Set **Production Branch** to `main` only
3. Disable **Auto-deploy** for other branches
4. Go to **Settings** → **Environments**
5. Create **Production** environment with:
   - ✅ Required reviewers (add yourself)
   - ✅ Restrict deployments to main branch only

#### Netlify Environment Protection

1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard** → **Site Settings** → **Build & Deploy**
2. Set **Production Branch** to `main` only
3. Disable **Branch Deploy** for production
4. Use **Deploy Hooks** only for authorized deployments

### 3. **Set Up GitHub Actions Protection**

The included `.github/workflows/production-protection.yml` will:

- ✅ Check for hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Run type checking and linting
- ✅ Verify build success
- ✅ Notify on production deployments

### 4. **Configure Required Status Checks**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **main** branch rule
2. Under **Require status checks to pass before merging**:
   - ✅ Add `security-check`
   - ✅ Add `build-check`
   - ✅ Add `deployment-check`

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### 1. **Environment Variables Protection**

- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Use `.env.example` for reference
- ✅ Rotate secrets regularly
- ✅ Use different secrets for different environments

### 2. **Code Review Requirements**

- ✅ All PRs must be reviewed
- ✅ No direct pushes to main
- ✅ Squash and merge only
- ✅ Delete feature branches after merge

### 3. **Monitoring and Alerts**

- ✅ Set up deployment notifications
- ✅ Monitor failed builds
- ✅ Track security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Regular dependency updates
