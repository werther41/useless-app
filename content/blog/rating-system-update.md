# New Rating System for Useless Facts

We're excited to announce the launch of our new rating system! Now you can rate the useless facts and help us understand what content resonates most with our community.

## How It Works

The rating system is simple and intuitive:

1. **Browse facts** on the homepage
2. **Click the rating buttons** (üëç or üëé)
3. **See real-time results** of community ratings
4. **Help us improve** the content quality

## Why We Added This Feature

We believe that community feedback is essential for creating the best possible experience. By allowing users to rate facts, we can:

- **Identify popular content** that users enjoy
- **Improve fact quality** based on feedback
- **Create a more engaging** user experience
- **Build a community-driven** platform

## What's Next

This is just the beginning! We're already working on additional features based on your feedback:

- **Advanced filtering** by rating
- **Personalized recommendations**
- **Community leaderboards**
- **Enhanced fact categories**

## Get Involved

We'd love to hear your thoughts on the new rating system. Try it out and let us know what you think!
